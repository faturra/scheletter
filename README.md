# Scheletter

SMP Negeri 162 Jakarta is one of the Public Junior High Schools in the DKI Jakarta Province, Indonesia. The school provides education for three academic years and plays a role in administrative correspondence activities involving various parties within the school. Although school data is based on the Basic Education Data (Dapodik), in practical correspondence, it does not yet support the integration of Dapodik data for the administration of digital letter creation, such as certificates, assignment letters, and general letters like invitations. Several studies have developed computerized correspondence systems, but improvements are still needed, especially in terms of document authenticity. This research examines the constraints in letter creation at SMP Negeri 162 Jakarta and reveals that suboptimal coordination, non-integrated data typing with Dapodik data sources, and conventional letter formats vulnerable to changes can hinder the school's administrative processes. Therefore, the implementation of digital correspondence control, standard office script procedures, and the integration of student and employee data from Dapodik are required to overcome these challenges. This study produces an application called Scheletter, an integrated correspondence application with Dapodik based on the web, utilizing QR Code technology for document authenticity verification. The application is designed using the Waterfall SDLC method, built using the Python programming language with the Django web framework, created based on a website. This application is expected to expedite the letter creation process, archive search, and proper archiving, making it user-friendly.
